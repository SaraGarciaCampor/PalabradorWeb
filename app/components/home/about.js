                        <p>
                            After graduating from secondary education I studied at the University School of
                            Translators and Interpreters (EUTI) of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, where I
                            obtained a degree in translation from English and German in June 1991.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started working as a freelance translator in 1995. Since then I have provided my
                            services to publishers, translation agencies, magazines, universities and private clients.
                        </p>
                        <p>In June 2007, after completing my studies at the University of Vic, I earned my
                            Bachelor’s Degree in Translation and Interpreting and was granted the Extraordinary
                            End-of-Degree Award. A year later, I was appointed as a sworn translator and
                            interpreter of English by the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Between 2007 and 2009 I was an Associate Lecturer at the University of Vic, where I
                            taught Legal and Business Translation and the Spanish Language Seminar.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In June 2004 I won first prize in the Andreu Febrer national translation contest.
                            For the last few years I have been combining translation with teaching in secondary
                            education.

                        <p>
                            My hobbies include night and long exposure photography, billiards, music, reading and
                            sport.
