                                I am also a sworn translator and interpreter for English, appointed by the Spanish
                                Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I regularly translate contracts, articles of association, deeds,

                                I use professional translation tools (Trados Studio, memoQ) to create glossaries and
                                translation memories to help maintain terminological consistency.
